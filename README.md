## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Evidence
[The Base in Onshape] (https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/e6efa9edf749929b2f82dab2/w/76f3e4c196954f29a414295b/e/9947b51b5e5f7dd3299be583)

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The second assignment ive done is a 120mm x120mm rectangle, centered on the origin,has 4 symmetric holes in the corners, 10mm in diameter, 20mm from each side (and therefore, 80mm from each other)and has another 25 mm circle in the center of the square.
