## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The second assignment ive done is a 120mm x120mm rectangle, centered on the origin,has 4 symmetric holes in the corners, 10mm in diameter, 20mm from each side (and therefore, 80mm from each other)and has another 25 mm circle in the center of the square.

### Reflection
Something i learned while making this was that i should always center the original sketch on the origin using guide lines first before extruding or adding any other components.

## Fork

### Description
*an 80 mm circle extruded 8 mm with 2 prongs with 10 mm holes 15 mm from the top and a 60 mm long shaft*

### Reflection
>It took me a while to figure out the chamfer but i looked it up on the tools database and was able to find it.This assignmnet was quite easy but definitly took me some 
time.

## Tire

### Description 
>It's a trapezoid that has ben revolved with 80 for the inside and 1110 for the outside with an 8 mm fillet on the outward edges.

### Reflection
>I had a lot of trouble revolving the trapezoid as I was quite confused about how to make the dimensions look correct but I learned how to revolve shapes and how to make wheels in Onshape.
